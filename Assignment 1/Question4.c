/*Amicable numbers are found in pairs. A given pair of numbers is Amicable if the sum of the
proper divisors (not including itself) of one number is equal to the other number, and vice-versa.
For example 220 & 284 are amicable numbers. First, we find the proper divisors of 220.
220: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110;
1+ 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 284;
Now, 284: 1, 2, 4, 71, 142;
1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220
Write a C program to check whether the input pair of numbers is amicable.*/
