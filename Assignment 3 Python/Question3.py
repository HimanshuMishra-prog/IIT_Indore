# Write a Python script that performs the following tasks on two large matrices A and B
# (e.g., 1000 Ã— 1000):
# a. Using vectorised operations, perform element-wise operations (addition, subtraction,
# multiplication, division) between the matrices.
# b. Use broadcasting to perform operations between a matrix and a vector (e.g., adding
# a vector to each row or column of a matrix).
# c. Implement custom operations that combine vectorized operations and broadcasting
# (e.g., scaling each matrix row by a different scalar).*/
